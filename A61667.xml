            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt, he removes from the <hi>Cherub to the threſhold, Ezek.</hi> 9.3. and there turns again, and reaſons the caſe, and takes notice of every weeping eye, and every ſad heart. <hi>Set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that ſigh.</hi> Then from the <hi>threſhold to the cherubims,</hi> chap. 10.18. and then falls a threatning and a promiſing; <hi>Yet will I be to them as a little ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary in the Countries where they ſhall come.</hi> At laſt from the <hi>Cherubims</hi> he departed to the <hi>Mountains,</hi> chap. 11.23. and thence he uſeth the utmoſt importunity, if at length by any means

There are thouſands in Hell, that are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the day that ever they were born to ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and arriv'd to ſuch Honours, and liv'd at ſuch Eaſe: theſe things were once taken to be good, nay, the only good; but now that the other ſide is turn'd up, and upon deliberate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, they are not like the things they were.

            <p>Here are two Arguments coucht in the Text it ſelf, to illuſtrate the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of this truth.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>The Lord cryes for Audience.</hi> He hath now ſent his Rod to plead his Quarrel, ſeeing his Prophets could not be heard; and now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands their attention to this his ſeverer Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: <hi>Hear ye the rod.</hi> Which clearly implies, that it hath a Voice; nay, an intelligible, though in it ſelf, an inarticulate Voice. His <hi>Rod,</hi> and his <hi>Word,</hi> are ſometimes <hi>Synonyma</hi> in Scripture; as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.4. <hi>He shall ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he ſlay the wicked.</hi> God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeak Rods, his Words do wound, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42993:63"/>kill. When he rides forth, as St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Cloathed with a veſture dipt in blood, and out of his mouth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a sharp ſword, that with it he should ſmite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron,</hi> &amp;c. And as he ſpeaks rods, ſo his rod ſpeaks and pleads with thoſe unto whom it is ſent.</item>
               <item>2. The Text tells us, <hi>that it is the Rod of divine and ſpecial appointment;</hi> which argues the <hi>End</hi> and deſign of it; it is a deſigned, and a deſigning Rod. God doth not ſhoot his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows at <hi>Random,</hi> without mark or aim; but he hath a <hi>Wherefore</hi> for every particular of his Providence. <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.30. This is one main uſe God makes of his Rod, to point at his meaning by it, and to give us the ſenſible and viſible <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Emblems</hi> of his mind. <hi>God ſpake in divers manners in time paſt, unto the Fathers, by the Prophets,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. <hi>But hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> And now, may I ſay, <hi>in divers manners too.</hi> Sometimes by his Word, in plain Scripture; ſometimes by the explaining, or awakening Miniſtry of it; and that either in Doctrine or Reproof and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; or in Promiſe and Incouragement; Sometimes by his Spirit, in the ſecret workings and whiſpers of it, in, and on the Conſcience; and ſometimes by his Rod; when our ſtupid Dulneſs, or perverſe Careleſneſs is grown to ſuch a paſs, that other means and wayes are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42993:64"/>ineffectual; then he takes up his rod, and points more plainly and convincingly at our duty, and engageth us in it, with the more fixed, and ſolemn reſolution. Thus far the Text it ſelf confirms its own truth: And let this ſerve at preſent to prove the <gap reason="foreign">

            </list>
            <p>I ſhall add but a word or two more, for the Demonſtration of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: and ſo proceed to the Interpretation of the voice.</p>
            <p>For Demonſtration, or why the Lords Rod ſhould have a Voice.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>For the glory of his Attributes.</hi> Gods <hi>Wiſdom, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> are highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it. To think that Divine Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſteer'd by a <hi>blind Instinct</hi> Neceſſity, or Caſualty, without ſome gloriouſly deſigned, and determined <hi>End,</hi> is Atheiſtically to blaſpheme his heavenly <hi>Wiſdom. Affliction cometh not forth of the duſt,</hi> Job 5.6. God has a <hi>Wheel within the wheel;</hi> a wheel of infinite Counſel and Wiſdom, which moves within the wheel of external Providence. <hi>Deus &amp; Natura nihil fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra agunt.</hi> Nay, it would greatly derogate from the glory of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to exerciſe his <hi>Rod,</hi> without ſome proportionable <hi>End:</hi> For, (to ſpeak with holy reverence) God is, as it were, bound in all his Divine Actions, to aim at his own Glory, becauſe there is no higher End, for all Humane, Angelical, or Divine <hi>Motions</hi> to terminate in. And wherein is he glorified more than in the high Exploits, and bleſſed Fruit of his Rod? This is, as it were, the <hi>Scepter,</hi> the <hi>Faſces</hi> of his Kingdom, the <hi>Coercive Laws</hi> of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42993:64"/>his Government, and the great viſible <hi>Pillars</hi> of his Juriſdiction over the ſons of men, Now it is certain, that on the account of his abſolute, and ſupreme Sovereignty, he may, without any violation of his Juſtice, diſpoſe both of Us and Ours, as he pleaſes; neither is he bound to give us an Account of his wayes, any more than we are bound to give the Worms we tread on an account of ours. He might deal with us with dumb blows, and never ſtand to reaſon the caſe with us. He once gave us both <hi>to know, to Will and Obey;</hi> and dare we think to enjoyn him to look up, or repair what we have loſt or ſpoi'd? Though we have pluckt out the <hi>eyes</hi> he gave us to ſee with, and ſtopt the <hi>ears</hi> he gave us to hear with, may he not in Juſtice require it at our hands? and that, not only by a <hi>Precept,</hi> but a <hi>Penal Law?</hi> Yet, ſuch is the bleſſed Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and condeſcention of his Grace and Mercy, that he will plead with us before he ſtrikes; nay, and his very <hi>Rod</hi> ſhall ſpeak, and that in ſuch a <hi>Dialect,</hi> as our poor, broken ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities may in ſome certain and ſaving manner apprehend.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>To reach his Ends.</hi> God's End is not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to manifeſt the greatneſs of his Almighty Power, nor the ſeverity of his Supreme Juſtice, in cruſhing in pieces the poor Potſheards of the earth; but to reduce his degenerate, fallen Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to a nearer Reſemblance, and fuller par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of that Bleſſed Image of his own, which he had at firſt enſtamped on them. <hi>Man</hi> was the <hi>Epitome</hi> of Gods ſix dayes work, the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42993:65"/>
                  <hi>Microcoſm,</hi> the little World, the <hi>Crown</hi> of his Creation: Therefore, when <hi>Man</hi> fell, this little World was ruin'd, and became a <hi>Chaos,</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and dark heap of all manner of helliſh, and rebellious Principles and Practices: ſo that ever ſince, God hath been on a New-Creation-work in the World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>compar'd</hi> with <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.17. And in this his <hi>new</hi> work he obſerves his <hi>old</hi> method; Firſt, he creates Light to work in, though not to work by: Light for his creature's ſake, but not for his own. God is now working on rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which muſt, in ſome meaſure, and in ſome ſenſe, co-operate, or work with him; what will ſerve again of the <hi>old ruines,</hi> muſt ſtand, as for the matter and ſubſtance of it: the old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Powers, New-wrought and Sanctified unto a <hi>new,</hi> yet its <hi>primitive,</hi> Order and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Now, I ſay, the caſe being thus, it would not ſeem ſo conducible to his End, to leave his creatures utterly in the dark, as to his mind and pleaſure, in and by ſuch Providences; for his Rod is as his Axe or Saw, to leſſen, or ſhorten, or ſhape us in any manner, for the place and uſe he hath decreed, and called us unto, and under theſe, we are not to be meerly <hi>paſſive,</hi> but <hi>active</hi> alſo. Let this ſuffice now to have been ſpoken, by way of confirmation of ſo plain and evident a Truth.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="2">2. Well, this, we hope, is ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, both from the light of Reaſon, Scripture, and Conſcience, <hi>that the Lords Rod hath a Voice.</hi> But what this Voice is, or how to give
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42993:65"/>the true and infallible <hi>Interpretation,</hi> is the <hi>Question:</hi> and were this Queſtion as earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, impartially, and practically debated and reſolved, as the <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Rue,</hi> the leſſer <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials</hi> and <hi>Punctilios</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> or of private and worldly <hi>Intereſt;</hi> there were ſome probable hope, nay, more than probable, that God might yet at laſt obtain the <hi>Glory</hi> he is contending, and we the happy <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we are looking and longing for. And for your help in this diligent and ſerious Search, give me leave to premiſe theſe four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Know therefore, in the firſt place, That when God ſpeaks to us by his Rod, he ſpeaks as to <hi>Rational</hi> creatures, that are capable of drawing Inferences, as well from his <hi>Works,</hi> as from his <hi>Word.</hi> God doth not work upon us as upon Stocks and Stones, that are <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſenſible of the Stroaks, and ignorant of the Workman's deſign; God hath principled us with an <hi>intellective</hi> Faculty, that we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude concerning his <hi>Will</hi> from his <hi>Works.</hi> Hence is that compaſſionate wiſh, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.29. <hi>O that they were wiſe! that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this! that they would conſider their latter end!</hi> And that ſad complaint, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Though I ſhould <hi>heap miſchiefs upon them, and ſpend mine arrows upon them;</hi> though <hi>the ſword without, and terrour within,</hi> ſhould <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both the young man, and the virgin, the ſuckling alſo, with the man of gray hairs;</hi> yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42993:66"/>who would lay it to heart? the <hi>filthy</hi> would be <hi>filthy</hi> ſtill, the <hi>wicked and deceivers</hi> would grow worſe and worſe ſtill; <hi>For they are a nation void of Counſel, neither is there any underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them.</hi> 'Tis true, we are ſenſible enough of the Smart of the Rod, but not of the End, and Deſign of it. In other things, that, compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, little or nothing concern us, we can, with an elaborate, and ſtudied exactneſs, run through the whole <hi>Series</hi> and concatenation of <hi>propinque</hi> and <hi>remote</hi> cauſes, and examine their mutual dependences and products; and yet how ſtrangely blind and ſottiſh are we in the caſe between God and our ſouls? Oh! whenever there is an evil in the <hi>Camp,</hi> a Judgment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or inflicted, on the Church, State, Town, Family, wherein you live, or on your own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or perſonal relations; let your next and ſpeedy courſe be, to make diligent Inquiſition to find out the <hi>Achan</hi> that hath mov'd the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and rais'd the <hi>Controverſie</hi> between God and you; that he may not upbraid your wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtupidity, as he did Iſraels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Hear, O Heavens, and give ear, O Earth!</hi> and verſe 5. <hi>Why should ye be ſtricken any more? ye will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vole more and more.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Alſo I ſo watchmen over you, ſaying, Hearken to the ſound of the Trumpet; but they ſaid, We will not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> Here God threatned Warr, by the ſound of the Trumpet, but all was one to them, <hi>we will not hearken.</hi> Therefore, ver. 19. <hi>Hear, O Earth Behold, I will bring evil upon this People, ever the Fruit of their own thoughts, becauſe the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42993:66"/>have not hearkened unto my words.</hi> Oh, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren! As you deſire, and hope to be ſaved from that Sword and Peſtilence, and all the other evils that are upon you, or impendent over you, and from the wrath to come; hearken to the ſound of Gods Trumpet, to the voice of Gods Rod: O, don't abandon your reaſon, and play the mad men in the things that do ſo nearly concern you! God is now contending with us for theſe and theſe things, and ſhall we not give him a ſober hearing? nay, we do hear, and feel too, that our ears do <hi>tingle,</hi> and our very hearts ake, and ſhall we not regard? O that ever this ſhould be ſaid of <hi>England!</hi> What? what will become of us? <hi>The Harp and the Viol, the Tabret and Pipe, and Wine are in their Feaſts, but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither conſider the operation of his hands. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my People are gone into captivity, becauſe they have no knowledge,</hi> Iſa. 5.12, 13. Let this be the firſt thing then remembred by the way, that whenever God doth lay his rod on you, he expects you ſhould take ſpecial notice of it, and ſet your ſelves with all ſeriouſneſs, ſpeed, and impartiality, to inquire into the true, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Meaning, and End of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Examine Conſcience by the Word of God. How doth the Phyſician underſtand the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his Patient, but by comparing and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Urine by the Rules of his Art? Caſt the Rod then into a clean <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinal</hi> of Conſcience, and examine what the Word of God will ſay of it there. Conſcience is Gods <hi>Deputy</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:42993:67"/>and if thou haſt not for the preſent <hi>ſcratcht</hi> out God; writing there; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I ſay, for theſe <hi>Characters</hi> will never be expung'd thoſe <hi>leaves,</hi> but by the ſame Divine hand that ingraved them. If thou haſt not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Impoſtures</hi> of thy own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived heart, but wilt be faithful and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; here thou ſhalt find a true, and plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Providence. We may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God ſhould ſpeak to us immediately from Heaven, <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> or by any miraculous Revelations or Enthuſiaſms, as ſome giddy <hi>Brains</hi> would pretend unto; this were indeed <hi>Phanaticiſm, nomine &amp; re.</hi> But, <hi>The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart.</hi> The Word ſpeaks, and the Rod ſpeaks, and Conſcience will compare theſe together, and from thence draw up a full and perfect <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and both prove, examine, and anſwer every <hi>Article</hi> of it, if it may but be ſuffer'd to execute its office in you. The great reaſon why we are ſuch ſtrangers to God, is becauſe we are ſuch ſtrangers to our ſelves: <hi>Nemo is ſeſe tentat deſcendere, nemo.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Perſ.</note> Affliction hath a great I fluence, as on the other powers of the Soul, ſo eſpecially on the Conſcience, either to ſoften or to fear it: Every ſtroke on <hi>Pharaoh</hi> left him harder and harder. <hi>Why will ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more.</hi> But where the rod is intended for good, and works toward that End, there it ſoftens and quickens the Conſcience. What a bleſſed effect had that <hi>Rout</hi> at <hi>Ai,</hi> on <hi>Joshua</hi>

They preſently fly to God, to know the Cauſe, and as ſoon as ever the thing was hinted to them, how induſtrious and reſtleſs were they, till they had found out the very <hi>Man,</hi> and executed Gods Law upon him, and ſo remov'd the Guilt and the Wrath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As there is a vaſt difference between the <hi>iron</hi> Rod of Gods hoſtile wrath, and the <hi>gentle</hi> Rod of his Fatherly Correction, in reſpect of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the Divine Attribute from whence it proceeds; ſo in reſpect of the End and Deſign of it too.

They can't ſee that beauty that lies within the skin, whereby the King's daughter is all glorious within.

But the other is freely to be remitted, on the account of Chriſt, and our obedience to him, and hope in him. O, take heed, that your froward, ſullen, and moroſe carriage and diſpoſition, do not harden, and juſtly prejudice thoſe, that might otherwiſe have been won, even ſuch, as were once ſome of you, be they, at preſent, never ſo vile.

But, for your further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, conſider; Have you had ſuch an eſteem of your Talents as you ought? Let me ask you then, On what account, or reaſon is it, that you ſo eſteem them? Do you prize them as they are <hi>Talents,</hi> and the things wherein your duty and diligence, and the glory of God, is bound up? Do you eſteem your work in them, as well as your enjoyment of them? Chriſtian! Ask thy heart, in earneſt, What is it that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fireſt, or prizeſt, thy Time, Health, Peace, Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or any other Priviledges or Enjoyments, for? Can you ſay, you prize them more for their ſervice, than for their ſweetneſs? more for Gods ſake, than for your own? The Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and therefore, the deſirableneſs of theſe things, lies in their End; Now the End of theſe things is not in themſelves, but they are ordained Means unto a higher End. To prize <hi>Health,</hi> for it ſelf, is not to prize it aright; Theſe are the only riches that a ſpiritual heart can take true content, and delight in, that are laid out for God. The Tradeſman, that means to thrive, will turn all he can into ſtock; a penny here, is of more value with him, than a ſhilling, that muſt lie dead by him. I ſhall ſay no more but this; You may judge of your own caſe, by your faithful, and practical applying of all theſe things unto their great and high End.</p>

Have you never been, even burden'd with your time, that you have invented ſuch things as <hi>Pastimes,</hi> to rid your hands of it? as if God had not allotted you work enough for your day: Nay, have you never begrutcht him, and your own Souls, any of that time which hath been their unqueſtionable due? Have Sabbaths and Duties, hath Prayer and Faſting, never been a wearineſs to you? Let Conſcience ſpeak now, and judge uprightly between God and us. And can we think, that God hath taken this well at our hands? Are not all theſe things written on that bloody Sword that is drawn out againſt us? What Talent have we more precious than our Time? 'tis that, wherein all the reſt are wrapt up. Were the day of Grace over, all the offers of Grace, and means of Grace, and hopes of Grace, ſhould be over too. Ah! could you but hear thoſe heart-melting groans, and fruitleſs wiſhes of the Damned, for one of your idle hours; how would it affect you? and, ſhould God at laſt ſend us thither, to learn the worth of Time; how ſadly ſhould we repent it, and rue it to all eternity!

What's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the ſins you have ſo often confeſſed, and complained of to God, and made as if you were ſo exceedingly wearie and aſham'd of, and troubled about? Would you willingly give God leave to ſearch every corner of your hearts and lives for them?

Where are the <hi>lively</hi> Fruits of your Repentance unto <hi>life,</hi> which may teſtifie for you, that it hath been in faithfulneſs, and in truth? han't your Repentances been like a <hi>Cake</hi> not turn'd, bak'd only on the top? or, like the Tears of the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> that ſeems to weep over the Prey, he inwardly rejoyceth in? Have you repented unto God, or unto men only? hath your Sorrow proceeded from the evil, and ſinfulneſs of ſin, or meerly from the danger of it? Oh, Chriſtians! as ever you expect comfort from any of your Graces, make theſe things clear to your ſelves. All your hopes of Pardon, and Juſtification, and conſequently, of all that good you expect in this World, or another, are built on the ſincerity
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42993:119"/>of your Repentance. What have you to do with Pardon without Repentance? I even trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to think of thoſe many thouſands in the world, that have made their own <hi>Pardons,</hi> and ſeal'd them with all their confidence; with what ſhame and horrour will their faces be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palled, when God ſhall tear theſe forged <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences</hi> out of their hands, and burn them, and their lying <hi>Pardons,</hi> together. Are not you ſome of thoſe that defie the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> with all his Lies and Effaſcinations? and what! will ye turn <hi>Popes</hi> to your own Souls? and ſell your Luſts the <hi>Indulgences</hi> of your own Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Ah, Brethren! Remember, A bare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is but an external concomitant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and a bare ſorrow for ſin, is but a part of Repentance. Your words, your tears, and your hopes, may all deceive you. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is a wonderful changing and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thing. See, how the Apoſtle deſcribes it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. <hi>For, behold, this ſelf ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a godly ſort, what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea, what clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your ſelves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement deſire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge?</hi> Oh! what a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there between our ſorrowing for ſin, and our ſorrowing for the croſſes and troubles of the world? how naturally do we grieve for theſe things! we need no Monitors here; our ſorrows ſeldom keep within their bounds. But when we come to mourn for ſin; how are we ſtraitned! how cold and dead are we! how
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42993:119"/>hard muſt we wring for a tear! what a tugg have we, to rub a little life into our frozen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections! like ſtones caſt into the air, they fly no farther, than the very dead force drives them, and then make haſte to their old <hi>Center</hi> again. Oh, my Brethren! what can we think of ſuch forced Repentings? If we repent, as it were, againſt our Wills, will God pardon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Will?</p>

But I ſhall ſay nothing to ſuch: the very light, and principles of Nature, do ſufficiently condemn them. The greater ſort of Parents think, they have done enough, nay, very wiſely and commendably, if, through their Care, Frugality, Labour, or Wits, they have brought them up to ſome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or competent Eſtate, that they may live in faſhion amongſt men.

Oh, Sirs! methinks your hearts ſhould bleed within you, to think what a prepoſterous courſe you are taking, to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42993:134"/>conſult the welfare of your dear children. Have they not immortal ſouls, as well as bodies, think you? Have you begotten beaſts, or Men? Is there an everlaſting eſtate, both of glory, and miſery, in the world to come? Are your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren born under the condemning ſentence of the Law; and the Wrath of Almighty God? If not, then expunge thoſe Scriptures out of the Book of God, that plainly affirm it; <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.46. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. with thoſe hundreds more, that ſpeak to the ſame thing. But, if God be true, and his Word muſt ſtand; then tell me, whether the Souls of your children be not of as great a value, and require as much of your care, as their Bodies. I cannot ſtand here, on the Inſtitutions of Family-Diſcipline; I am, at preſent, but your brief <hi>Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> though in a ſomewhat lax, and digreſſive way.

Believe it, and take not mine, but God's word for it, <hi>It comes with the fear.</hi> Your carnal fear
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42993:147"/>brings the ſnare, and tempts God to give you up to that which you ſtand in ſuch fear of. I might give you a plain, and natural experiment, to this purpoſe. Such is the weakneſs of ſome heads, that walking on a very high, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Clive, if they come but ſo near, as to look out over, and to ſee the danger; they are ſo ſurpriz'd with the ſudden fear, that they even dote on what they ſo extreamly dread, and caſt themſelves headlong, though their footing were ſure, and room to eſcape ſufficient. Similar hereunto, is that of Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.35. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will ſave his life,</hi> he that is afraid to loſe his life, <hi>ſhall loſe it; but, whoſoever ſhall liſe his life, i. e.</hi> though not <hi>actually,</hi> yet <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi> he that is not afraid, but ready to loſe it, if called thereunto, <hi>ſhall ſave it,</hi> in this world, or, at leaſt, in another. Now, pray ſit down, and count your gains; ſee what a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Satan, and your unbelieving hearts, are trading together for. The Devil would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to teach you a nearer, or a cheaper, and eaſier way to Heaven, than ever Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: and, if you will, you may believe him. But when you are caught in the fatal ſnares of your own carnal fears, and ſhifts; then ſit down, and thank your ſelves: and remember, who once was ſent on purpoſe, to warn you of it.

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42993:160"/>walk by their own laws, or the laws of men in things pertaining to the Kingdom of Chriſt, are the Enemies of his Kingdom.

Now I befeech you, if your Souls, and the ſecuring of your eternal peace, be ſo much worth; make a little pauſe here, and ſoberly conſider, what infallible, nay, probable evidences you can produce to prove your pretended Converſion; whether they are ſuch as God in his word ſpeaks peace through, and on which after ſerious and due deliberation, you can boldly and ſafely adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your fouls on for ever. Nay, are there not many, and I think, never more amongſt a Chriſtian people, that even hate and diſdain the imputation of Repentance and Converſion, and yet cannot ſo much as queſtion whether they are the enemies of Chriſt or no.

God hath claſht the <hi>Bells</hi> of Nature, nay, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the <hi>Bells</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi> too, and can none of theſe things affect us? oh that God would now drive home and faſten theſe Nails upon you! that he would graciouſly perſwade you to hear the Rod, and him who hath appointed it.</p>
            <p>Proceed we now to anſwer one Query briefly; How to Judge of the particular Voice of this or that particular Rod. And that I may commend the practice of this Search to you, give me leave to premiſe theſe three or four <hi>Incentives.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>'Tis an excellent way to gain by the Rod.</hi> Though the <hi>Balm</hi> be never ſo Soveraign and good; yet if the Patient knowes not how or where to apply it, it is never like to effect the cure. Correction without inſtruction is the way to harden, not to reform. This ſeems to be one main cauſe why God was even weary of ſmiting <hi>Iſrael.</hi> There was no end in it; <hi>ye will revolt more and more.</hi> The more I ſtrike, the more ye revolt; I may ſtrike you dead, and all will be one. The reaſon is, <hi>Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider, Iſa.</hi> 1.3. Therefore <hi>Doctrine</hi> muſt go with <hi>Reproof,</hi> and <hi>Inſructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in righteouſneſs</hi> with <hi>correction;</hi> then both the Word, and the Rod will be <hi>profitable</hi> and ſucceſsful. Chriſtian:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6.</note> this is the way to turn thy ſaddeſt loſſes to thy beſt advantage: To extract <hi>Ex vipera theriacam,</hi> out of poyſon an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt poyſon: To turn <hi>Egyptians</hi> againſt
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42993:166"/>
                  <hi>Egyptians;</hi> this is the art and happineſs of a Chriſtian, To ſet his loſſes, his hazzards, his croſſes, his miſeries, nay, death it ſelf, among his richeſt gains.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>'Tis a notable courſe to make the yoak eaſie.</hi> What's that makes any caſe grievous or deſperate, but this, when we know not how to help it? How doth it trouble and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet you, when a friend is angry, and you know not why or wherefore? or how to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to reconcile him? Onely this you know, that he will not be angry without great and juſt cauſe. The knowledge of the Cauſe is alway the firſt direct ſtep to the Cure. You will never go cheerfully under the yoak, as long as you go in the dark as to the end and meaning of it.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>'Tis a ſpecial means to improve your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and to ſtrengthen your watch.</hi> This will bring thee better acquainted with all the falſe corners and <hi>Caves,</hi> the windings and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> of thy heart and life. When you have not only bin taught or threatned, but whipt out of an errour, it will be a good token with you as long as you live. What you have once ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſmarted for, you will the more carefully watch againſt. The reaſon why we are at ſuch loſſes in thoſe Circumſtantials, wherein the Word is ſilent, is, becauſe we have not obſerved nor underſtood the Rule, wherein the Rod hath ſpoken more plainly. The Rod is the <hi>Feſtu</hi> in Gods hand, whereby ſometimes he teacheth his children to ſpell his word. The <hi>Theorie</hi> of any art is not ſo throughly underſtood, till the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:42993:166"/>make it familiar. Your Coſtly experiences will be your ſtanding experiences. Oh what a ſtaff will this be in your hands, when you are ſtaggering and halting between Faith and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon! when conſcience ſhall ſtand up and urge you with former experiences, This way I dare not adventure on, God hath met with me here already, and convinc'd me that it is out of my way; the laſt time I was wandring in this or the like unwarrantable path, I ſadly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what frowns were given me, and how dear it coſt me; and should I be found in the ſame or the like way again, will he not make me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it as long as I live? and leave ſuch a mark on me as shall cauſe me to go limping and lamenting to my grave?</item>
               <item>4. <hi>'Tis the only way to have the affliction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd with advantage.</hi> Suppoſe, now God is afflicting thee in thy Health, or Liberty, or in thy worldly Deſignes or Hopes: It's not thy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe in ſuch a caſe, to find out and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the immediate and natural cauſe of it? if this be accompliſhed, and the effect, which troubled thee, ceaſe, thou rejoyceſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeſt thy courſe, and by and by all is forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; the wound is cur'd, and all is well, and the Plaiſter laid up for the next like occaſion: thus the Rod loſeth its end, and doth but ſtop thee in thy way, not turn thee out of thy way; and hence it follows, that if God intend thee any good, he muſt ſend ſtronger meſſengers after thee, which, it may be, are forc't to knock thee down before thou wilt yield. But ſuppoſe that
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42993:167"/>God ſhould leave thee to thy own courſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move natural evils with natural Remedies, and to look no higher; unto what a diſtance from God wouldſt thou in a ſhort time wander? Nay, though thou acknowledgeſt thy ſin in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or in many principal or particular branches of it, and indeavoureſt to humble thy ſoul in truth before God; yet if that <hi>Achan</hi> the chief Author of the preſent diſpleaſure be not found out and executed according to the law of God, thou art as lyable ſtill, to the ſame miſcarriage, and to the ſame affliction, as ever thou wert be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Though the Rod may have wrought ſome good on thee, yet it hath not reacht that good.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Let this ſerve to move you unto the Duty, through the bleſsing of him that watereth the Furrows of Sion, and cauſeth his people to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. I come now to anſwer unto this great and neceſſarie Query.</p>
            <p>To be peremptory or poſitive in this caſe is dangerous. Gods waies are ſometimes in the dark: <hi>his counſels are a great deep,</hi> where it may be as unſafe for us to ſeek him, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find him. Yet I am not leading you into a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of endleſs or fruitleſs labour, nor introducing unto the contemplation of a <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Idea,</hi> nor about to perſwade you to turn <hi>Oracles</hi> to your ſelves. That which I have to propoſe is not intended to diſtract thee, but to direct thee. Here is certainly a Pearl of great price hid; a Gemme of infinite value; Digg, and thou ſhalt find it; find it, and it ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich thee both in this world, and in a better.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42993:167"/>And as you hope to underſtand the Counſel of God in this buſineſs, ſet your ſelves with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſeriouſneſs and impartiality to ſeek it of God in the diligent uſe of theſe, and any other Directions that ſhall from God be ſuggeſted to thee.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Confider what were thy laſt miſcarriages.</hi> Deal with thy ſelf as Phyſitians are wont to do with their Patients. <hi>What was the laſt die you fed upon?</hi> Poſsibly, there may be ſomething in the Nature, the Quality or quantity of it, which may produce ſuch a diſtemper. Was there no diſtaſte or diſlike in the ſtomack at, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, the reception of it? No Reluctance or doubting in conſcience about any thing you have lately done, or ſpoken, or purpoſed, or adviſed, or omitted? Sometimes, God is pleaſed to intimate his diſpleaſure by his Rod in the firſt ſtep of our departure from him, He that hath commanded us to call upon him while he is near, is ſometimes pleaſed to obſerve his own Law, and calls upon us while we are near, to reckon with us while it is hot: before we are gone out of hearing, as it were. I need not heap up Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Inſtances to this purpoſe: daily experience is ſufficient evidence.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>What are the cructations of thy conſcience?</hi> Is there nothing, that Conſcience doth begin to accuſe thee of? that thou couldſt wiſh had been done, or left to doing? When <hi>David</hi> had num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the people, ſee how conſcience did preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begin to work within him, <hi>His heart ſmote him,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. What ever thou doeſt,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42993:168"/>take heed of overlaying thy conſcience, or ſtifling the operations of it: If this lye ſpeechleſs in ſuch a caſe, its a ſigne the diſeaſe is dangerous: when the Stomack is overcharged, either in Quantity or Quality, it loatheth the very thoughts of meat: but eſpecially of that, whereon it ſurfeited. <hi>My Sin is ever before me,</hi> ſaies <hi>David. Pſal.</hi> 51.3. 'Tis true the ſin of his nature comes into his thoughts, as the root and ſpawn of all the reſt: but 'tis this particular guilt, that alwaies returns with its gaſhly and dreadful aggravations upon him.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Sometimes the Puniſhment bears reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with the Sin.</hi> Suffering is the Off-ſpring of ſin; and oftentimes it begets children in its own likeneſs. God ſometimes deals with us <hi>Lege Talionis,</hi> and requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth us <hi>like for like.</hi> So he dealt with <hi>Agag,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.33. <hi>As thy ſword hath made women childleſs, ſo ſhall thy mother be childleſs among women.</hi> Such was that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God on thoſe <hi>Sodomites</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Receiving in themſelves that recompence of their errour which was meet.</hi> He meted out a puniſhment, that ſhould ſuit with their impiety, and made their very ſin to be their ſnare. Thus he doth often, as it were, write our <hi>accuſation</hi> on our <hi>croſs,</hi> and cauſe the ſuffering to bear the very picture of the Sin. Nay, after this manner God dealt with <hi>David</hi> himſelf: When he began to glory in, or to truſt to, the multitude and ſtrength of his forces; God ſhortned them by <hi>ſeventy thouſand men.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.15. So when he had ſinned by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42993:168"/>and Murder: Murder and Adultery was his puniſhment, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.10, 11. Thus alſo God met with <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.19. But to mention no more: this is one of the commoneſt and cleareſt Rules we have to judge by in this caſe. Hath God croſt thee in any of thy delights? Conſider whether thy delight were lawful in its ſelf and in its circumſtances, or the uſe of it, moderate and ſubordinate. Hath he ſmitten thee in ſome dear Relation? Conſider whether it had not too much of thine heart, or of thy time, thy care, or fond Indulgence. Hath he afflicted thee in any part of thy Body? Conſider how thy Body (or, it may be, that part eſpecially) hath been employed either to Gods honour or diſhonour. Haſt thou met with any fruſtration, danger, or evil ſucceſs in thy enterprize? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what were thy ends. Of whom didſt thou ask counſel? or crave aſsiſtance? See whether there be not ſome offence near thee, of which thy puniſhment may claim parentage. The firſt Queſtion we uſe to ask the Patient is this, Where doth your pain lie? Wherein are you grieved moſt? And then examine, whether that part be not ſuffering under its own guilt. It may be thou art in a languiſhing, pining caſe, under ſom hereditary diſtemper, and haſt alwayes ſomthing to complain of. Why, may not God then be preſenting to thee the Condition of thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul by the eſtate of the body, and viſiting for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he ſin of thy enſtome or Conſtitution? When God enters into a Courſe of Phyſick with thee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s an Argument that the diſeaſe is rooted in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42993:169"/>thee, and let me add this as a ſure Rule, by the way. <hi>Every Affliction hath a general, if not a ſpecial eye and aime at thy moſt beloved, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, or accustomed Sin.</hi> Though particular miſcarriages be often times attended with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular corrections; yet both, it may be, are properly reducible unto thy maſter-Laſt, the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet thee, as the root of all: for one and the ſame ſin may diſcover its ſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe waies, that ſeem aliene from its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For illuſtration take this plain example. A man that is naturally <hi>Scorbutical,</hi> and lies under the Phyſitians hands for that diſeaſe, but while this is under cure, he falls into a <hi>Feaver,</hi> or <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie,</hi> or <hi>Dropſie,</hi> or the like; unto which the Phyſitian applies his art diverſly; yet in all he does, hath a due reſpect unto the former and great infirmity, which is as the fountain of the reſt, and creates him all this toyl, and variety of Methods and Compoſitions. Hence I conclude then, that he that is not acquainted with his Maſter-ſin, the King or Prince of his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; is not like to go farr, with any ſucceſs or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al advantage, in his ſearch.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>It may be God afflicts thee for prevention of a worſe evil. I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall that ſhe ſhall not find her pathes. Hoſ.</hi> 2.6. God will ſet thorns in his ſheeps paths, to keep them from breaking from him. This was the courſe God took with St. <hi>Paul.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Left I ſhould be exalted above meaſure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in

It may be, that God is fitting thee for ſome more than ordinary mercy, and laying the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſome fair building; if ſo, marvail not, nay, bethink it not if he digg deep in thee.</item>
               <item>5. <hi>Conſider, what is thy Patience under the Rod:</hi> An impatient high colour, and the thick and eager beating of the Pulſe of thy complaints are the Symptoms of a Feaver, and gives cauſe to think that unbelief and impatience is, at leaſt, an <hi>Aſsiſtent,</hi> if not the <hi>Principal</hi> cauſe.<note place="margin">Pelluntur ignibus ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> 'Tis an ordinary thing with God, to drive out one heat with another.

He knowes that exerciſe is the way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and to ſtrengthen habits. If thou wouldſt that God ſhould give over his afflicting, thou muſt learn to give over thy fretting.

               <item>6. <hi>It may be Gods deſign is only or chiefly, for thy tryal.</hi> To diſcover to thy ſelf that which was hid, whether it be grace or corruption.

If ſo, you are yet ſhort of that which is God's, and ſhould be your, deſign.

Nay, what ever it be that God hath plac't thy duty in, it is deſireable for thy duties ſake. A true Souldier had as liev fight the Battel, being called to it, as to divide the Spoyl: and yet is not fool-hardie, to ruſh on dangers, without a Commiſſion. <hi>Theſe are they which follow the Lamb whither ſoever he goeth Rev.</hi> 14.4.

It grieves my ſoul to think that I should beſtow ſo much of my time and labour to aggravate

What Duty, what Sin have you been convinc't of? what ſearch have you made, and what have you found? Have we been fishing, not onely all night, but all this year, and caught nothing? What ſpiritual weapon, what experience, what courage, what victory, what grace have you gotten or ſtrengthned? oh ſit down and shake your <hi>Netts;</hi> ſee what you have gotten.

Ah my Brethren! theſe are the things you have adventured hard for, that you have hazzarded, and it may loſt ſomthing for, and have you gotten no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make it up again?

            <p n="1">1. That we ſhould provoke God thus to deal with us. We, the People of ſuch mercies and deliverances whom God hath ſo highly honour'd and made the head and not the tail of the Nations; whoſe part he hath taken againſt all the world, and manifeſted his high account of us in the face of our enemies. Surely any Nation under Heaven might better have done it than <hi>England. You onely have I known of all the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42993:176"/>Families of the earth; therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities, Am.</hi> 3.2. Is it a ſmall offence that hath drawn out ſuch a Flood of wrath? Oh let us ſit down and weep here! we that even now were ſitting among the Lillies are now toſt and torn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the thorns and briers. Our peace is broken both with God and Man; our health and plenty is declining like a Shadow; we are ſore broken as in the place of Dragons. <hi>O that my head were waters! and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the ſlain of the daughter of my people! O that I had in the wilderneſs a lodging place of waifaring men! that I might leave my people and go from them. For they be all Adulterers an Aſsembly of treacherous men! Jer.</hi> 9.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we are no more ſenſible of the Rod, nor bettered by it. This is the ſaddeſt judgment on this ſide Hell, to be given up to a hard heart, a ſpiritual Lethargy; When Calls and Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Judgments will not work, he hath but one way more, as to viſible means, to make work with a People: Ruine and Deſolation will make work, but ſad work! Hell and damnation will make work with the ſtubborneſt heart that ever ſinned againſt God. Ah ſinner! there is a Rod that will awaken thee; there are arrows that will pierce thee; there are flames that will warm thee; there are Fiends that wil ſurely daunt thee, and chains that shall bind thee to all eternity; there's a Diſcipline that shall tame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
